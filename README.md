# Amplifier OpenAI Provider Module

GPT model integration for Amplifier via OpenAI's Responses API.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** - Fast Python package manager

### Installing UV

```bash
# macOS/Linux/WSL
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Purpose

Provides access to OpenAI's GPT-5 and GPT-4 models as an LLM provider for Amplifier using the Responses API for enhanced capabilities.

## Contract

**Module Type:** Provider
**Mount Point:** `providers`
**Entry Point:** `amplifier_module_provider_openai:mount`

## Supported Models

- `gpt-5-codex` - GPT-5 optimized for code (default)
- `gpt-5` - Latest GPT-5 model
- `gpt-5-mini` - Smaller, faster GPT-5
- `gpt-5-codex` - Code-optimized GPT-5
- `gpt-5-nano` - Smallest GPT-5 variant

## Configuration

```toml
[[providers]]
module = "provider-openai"
name = "openai"
config = {
    default_model = "gpt-5-codex",
    max_tokens = 4096,
    temperature = 0.7,
    reasoning = "low",
    enable_state = false
}
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Usage

```python
# In amplifier configuration
[provider]
name = "openai"
model = "gpt-5-codex"
```

## Features

### Responses API Capabilities

- **Reasoning Control** - Adjust reasoning effort (minimal, low, medium, high)
- **Stateful Conversations** - Optional conversation persistence
- **Native Tools** - Built-in web search, image generation, code interpreter
- **Structured Output** - JSON schema-based output formatting
- **Function Calling** - Custom tool use support
- **Token Counting** - Usage tracking and management

### Tool Calling

The provider now detects OpenAI Responses API `function_call` / `tool_call`
blocks automatically, decodes JSON arguments, and returns standard
`ToolCall` objects to Amplifier. No extra configuration is requiredâ€”tools
declared in your config or profiles will execute as soon as the model requests
them.

## Dependencies

- `amplifier-core>=1.0.0`
- `openai>=1.0.0`
